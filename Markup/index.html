			Now fast-forward a couple of years. XHTML was the <em>W3C's</em> baby. But with a <a href="http://intertwingly.net/stories/2006/12/05/mathmlAndSvgForHTML4.js">not-particularly-long snippet of JavaScript</a>, Sam Ruby has kicked the chair out from under XHTML. Actually, that's not really the right image. Imagine a man with a chiseled jaw in a nearly immaculate tuxedo, Agent XHTML, clinging desperately to the edge of a sheer cliff with just two fingers.

			Look, go ahead and serve up "XHTML" as text/html. Really! So what? Yes, yes, if you actually served up your page with the right mime type so that it actually got parsed as <em>XML</em> instead of <em>invalid HTML</em>, <a href="http://h3h.net/2005/12/xhtml-harmful-to-feelings/#comment-10191">your website would completely fall over</a>.

			So at great personal expense, my crack team of <a href="http://pwcglobal.com" title="Bloodsucking lee-- I mean, helpful compliance officers">PricewaterhouseCoopers</a> auditors worked night and day to compile a full compliance report. Of the <a href="http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/Apr/index.html#tests" title="The XHTML 100">three X-Philes tests</a>, the auditors only  conducted the first test ("The Simple Validation Test") and the third test ("The MIME-type Test"). As for validating three secondary pages ("The Laziness Test"), I am sorry to report that we simply could not include this metric in the test suite given current budgetary constraints. Look, when these guys are costing $54,000 a week, you have to cut corners somewhere.

			First, Carroll has set the height and width of his scrollable section to "100%" instead of a fixed size. This means that the box automatically expands as large as it needs to be to contain its content. Therefore Carroll's scrollable section always is large enough to contain all of its content; therefore overflow never kicks in; therefore the section never generates the desired scrollbars, no matter how much "Bah Humbug" text Carroll adds.

Henceforth I am to be known as "Evan Goer Nahasapeemapetilon."  And to really drive the point home to friends and family, I'm dumping goer.org for a more appropriate domain name.
