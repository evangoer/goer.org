<span class="title">Norway #1</span>

<p>For my first email from Norway, I shall impress you with the three new <br />
letter you can't type <br />
æ å ø <br />
Cool, eh?</p>

<p>We traveled for about 24 hours to get here, including a red eye from Chicago to Frankfurt, and boy, did that next day have jet-lag written all  over it...<br />
We took the train to Lillihammer, home of the 94 Winter Olympics, crashed there for a day, then moved to Trondheim, the 2nd or 3rd largest town in Norway. Here we stayed with some relatives of Karin's mom, and all is good. The hospitality we've seen here is unlike anything else. <br />
As it turns out, we are going to school about an hour's drive from  Trondheim in a small town called Rissa. This will be grand, as we can hop the bus to the big city on long weekends. <br />
The school looks grand. We dropped off some luggage, and met the people,  who do speak some english. The view out our window opens over a hay field<br />
with a red barn on the other side, a lake behind that, and sweeping hills  cloaked in green forest. It's good. <br />
We head off to school tomorrow, and I'll write more when I can, but I don't <br />
know if we have access to these things when at the school... so don't be insulted if I don't write for a bit. Or it means I'm having too much fun. </p>
