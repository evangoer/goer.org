<span class="title">Long Bows and Massage Class</span>

Yes, that's right, Massage Class.
<br>
But first, we spend a week 'researching' something 'that interested us', and I got stuck on the group doing long bows. Which isn't what I was interested in, and that happened because I wasn't really suppose to want to do some thing that interested  <i>me </i>, I think I lost something in the translation. But it turned out to be kinda fun anyway.
<br>
After some 'research' on the web we found some sites that described in pretty good detail how to make one of these things. That was good. Searching for the wood to use, for you cannot use just any tree, was less good. Only half of the wood has arrived by now, and it's nearly 2 weeks after we started hunting. So, we don't have any built yet. But there is enough interest in it, I'm sure it'll get done before spring arrives, and seeing a homemade bow in action is something I'm looking forward to.
<br>
The massage class wasn't so exciting. I was feeling a bit under the weather for this week, and I didn't really show up to the whole class, but from what I did see it wasn't quite my cup of tea. I was after, I think, sports massage. Where you work out cramps, and stretch things and generally tenderize the body. The class was more Eastern healing. Rub this center of energy, stroke this way to move it, then go over here and press on the forehead type stuff. Not the Here's How To Get a Stiff Hamstring Working Again. Not really practical for me. Oh well. I can't complain too much, the days I did make it to class were good. Half the time I was on the table.
