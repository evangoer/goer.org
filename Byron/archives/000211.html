<span class="title">Karin Leaves!</span>

Karin has decided to apply to Law School. This has several implications beyond me marrying well, such as her leaving this weekend.
<br>
The figuring that got her to getting out of here was something like this: law school applications are due be March, and part of that is the LSAT, and that needs a few months to study, and that is offered in February. So, off to study she has gone, heading up to her grandmothers way up north. So far up north it's already gone black, the sun has risen for the last time until spring. I hear it's not totally black, but  a sunless noon sounds a bit evil to me.
<br>
So, we took off to Trondheim on Friday, to hang out, do some shopping, get some hot-chocolate and then put her on the bus that goes to the airport on Monday afternoon.  We had a grand time this weekend. It was spent at Guri's and Tore's house, relatives of Karin, in front of the TV. They have cable. We logged 8 hours on Friday. Something similar on Sunday. Good stuff.
<br>
And Refried Beans!  We went shopping to get dinner parts for Friday, and I found my beans! I was so excited, I have not had a bean and cheese burrito in a quarter of a year, which is rather traumatic after eating like 5 a week for the past few years. I had planned on taking the 3 cans back to school to use in an emergency, but when Karin saw them they became dinner. I had underestimated her dependence on this substance. We ate 2 of them, along with Jalapeno peppers, and this 'HOT' salsa that had a nice mellow flavor. Oh man that was good.
<br>
In'n Out! I found an In'n Out substitute! Not that my existence revolves around food, but it was a weekend full of exciting culinary discoveries. This one burger place, O'Martins, I think, serves lots of stuff from pasta to salad to burgers. And their burgers have a sauce similar to that pink goo In'n Out slathers on their burgers. If I closed my eyes, I could almost hear the potato chopper in the background... And this fast food dining experience set back a cool 175 Kroner. For both of us, that was about 25 American Green Backs.

<br>
I tried to do some shopping while in town, and traffic was brutal. Not so much the cars, that was OK because we had our own spot at the hospital where Guri works, but people traffic on the streets and in the stores. I waited 30 minutes at an electronics store to ask somebody if they had a cable. I never made it. I may have had another 15 minutes more had I stayed. I couldn't believe it. Fry's has better service then this. Goes to show ya, if you want the things that a lot of people will produce (like a city with stores) you have to put up with the lot of people.
<br>

And then, on Monday, Karin got on a bus to the airport. I shall see her again on December 22nd. We got those Christmas calenders with the chocolate behind each day, and are using them to count down the time until I get up there.
