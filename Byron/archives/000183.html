<span class="title">Norway #2</span>

<p>So far thing here are going pretty darn good.  </p>

<p>Here is the latest adventure coming up....<br />
a 7 day sailing trip which we start on Friday. There is talk of sailing a racing regatta (or something modern and fast) from Trondheim to Oslo. If we don't  get to do that, we'll take out the 42 foot wooden square sail ship for the  week. If I'm smiling after that, I think will be good to go. The food is really good, but old habits die hard, and I find myself whistling the In'n Out song in my head...</p>

<p>The feeding schedule is about like:<br />
8am -breakfast : cold cuts, cheese, bread, caviar, peanut butter, brown cheese ( a Norwegian specialty), strawberry jam, blueberry jam, orange marmalade, oatmeal, cereals, etc... and the milk is the best I've had.And  I'm a bit of a milk consumer. It is, I'm told, straight from the cows they  have on the farm. Friggin great stuff. <br />
12 - lunch : same sandwich material as in breakfast. It's a bit odd to<br />
have  salami out for breakfast, but it's darn good for lunch. <br />
4pm dinner 1 : usually something hot and good. This is my favorite meal.<br />
 7 7:30pm dinner 2 : cold sandwich stuff.<br />
9 Sometimes tea : dessert cakes and coffee and tea.<br />
Yes, that's 4 feedings a day, sometimes 5.</p>

<p>Saturday is Grøt, kind of like rice pudding, but seems to have some larger  oatmeal-like chunks in it. It's served with butter, Cinnamon and sugar. I  had 2 bowls.</p>

<p>Sunday is less feedings, but we have a large dinner at 6. That was excellent.</p>

<p>On the food note, things are more expensive here, including food. We ate out a few times in the local Big City of Trondheim, and the pizza joint was about 30 bucks for a large pizza. A /bit/ expensive. A large Coke, .8 liters, was, are you sitting down, 6 bucks. No shit. 6 bucks. I couldn't belive that. </p>

<p>We did a camping trip overnighter from Friday to Saturday. That was good. It rained on is most of the time. We got to chop trees, Axe them into small  pieces, paint the house with tar, built shelters, and pick the berries that  make to above jams. Good times.</p>

<p>Have a few days until the big trip on Friday, so I'm going to be relaxing and eating lots.</p>

<p>We did some shopping in Trondheim at the Army Surplus store, and got some great deals on loads of cold weather gear, and had a fantastic hamburger.<br />
And then a few days later we went back and picked up some sailing gear. I've got a full rain suit just like in 'The Perfect Storm'. Including the<br />
hat. Mine is white. </p>

<p>I got all this gear for a reason. The first sailing trip we did was last week, and I got cold and wet. So now have overkilled the solution to the problem and will never be cold or wet again. Engineers at work. <br />
And this is only the first week and a half. I'm in a Disney Adventure Vacation for another 30 weeks.  Wow.</p>
