<span class="title">Norway #6</span>

And finally the trip arrives. And we depart.
This week is spend on an island chasing sheep, and on the boats getting 
there and  back. Much happens, and as usual, I'll start somewhere else and 
then get to the beginning.
<br>
Inar: The boat building teacher. Friggin huge guy. I think he's like six 
six and 250 or 280 with hands twice the size of mine. He's been building 
boats for many many years, and it pretty amazing with axes, knives, saws, 
and other wood working type things. He also is the woodworking teacher. 
<br>
'2 hours to 2 days'. That's the answer to the question 'how long does it
take to get there?'. The island is about 40 or 80 miles (what's 3dB) away
 and we had to load up 4 sail boats to get the entire class over there.
 All the boats were the same design of varying sizes, and rightly so I was
placed on  the biggest one. Den Siste Viking II. The Last Viking 2. I
love that name.  It's a replica of the last working boat of this type,
which lives in a  museum now.  This sucker is huge, OK.. big. Much bigger
then the one we  have used up till now. It's like 4000 kilos of wood,
with 5000 kilos of iron ballast, about 50 feet or so. Plus us and our 
stuff. Sure would be bad to be stuck between this boat and a rock.
The weather was shitty for sailing, which was great for sitting out on the
 boat and getting some sun. Winds of a few knots, no waves, no clouds,
and  the biggest one of all -no rain. Rain sucks like a Hover when you're
 on a sail boat with no cabin.
The trip was very good, and we ended up stopping for the night before we
got  to the island. The weather was that nice. Karin had taken an oar to
the  head on her boat was not feeling all that well, so we took out the
tent and  camped on shore. Good thing we did, the wake from every passing
big boat that night rocked our small wooden ships for several minutes.
Fun when you're awake, not fun when your trying not to be.
Food on these boat trips is pretty typical of the school. Oatmeal for
breakfast with lots of additives (apple sauce, raisins, sugar, nuts,
etc.),  lunch is open face sandwiches with cheese and meats. We do pretty
well. Oh! I almost forgot, and would you have been pissed if I had. We
climbed the masts! With the light wind and calm seas, we tied up with
another boat while sailing and chatted a bit. A few people climbed up the
 mast ropes and sat on top of the sail. And somebody even  climbed the
top  sail, and on our boat that's quite an achievement. Østain was one of
the  climbers on our boat, which was fine until his boat untied from us
and  began to depart. He made the fastest side down  the rope I've seen
followed  by the quickest jump over to the other boat at it pulled away.
Quite  exciting, really.  Right around lunchtime we made it to the
island.
<br>
We landed, tied up the boats to the shore and set about making camp. And
tying up to shore is not as simple as that sentence makes it sound. 2
boats  are tied directly to the rock cliff, and 2 more boats are tied
onto one of  these. So, getting off the outside boat means jumping over 3
boats, jumping  off the last boat as it bounces in the water onto the
cliff, then climbing  up the cliff, sometimes with the aid of a rope
sometimes not. Did I mention  that my boots didn't stick to this wet
rock? Yea, like ice. From the top of  the cliff to the water is 50 feet
or so, not something nice if you slip.  And we did this stuff at night
also. A few people slipped, but nobody got  hurt. On the island a few
tents  went up, and work began on  getting stuff off the boats.
<br>
 Sheep Herders. That was our job for most of a day. It's
suppose to take a few hours. Either the sheep are smarter this year or the
 class is dumber, but we took all day.  The plan was to set up a  fence
funnel that led into a cage and chase them into the funnel. Easy.  A
crack  team of Runners set out. A lazy team of Sitters set out. We (the
Sitters)  lined up on top of  hill that would be one of 2 ways the sheep
could go,  the other being into the funnel. The Runners, true to their
name, found the  herd and chased them into the general direction of us
and the funnel. Our  job was to stand up and clap our hands if the sheep
looked like they were  going to go passed us, thereby scaring them into
our funnel.  Easy.  We  sat, and the runners ran for about 30 minutes.
First time the Sitters aren't set right, and the sheep run through a
hole. We sat again, and the runners ran for about 30 minutes.
Second time the sheep outflank us.
We sat again, and the runners ran for about 30 minutes.
Third time the sheep go /right through/ us. I was there. We had a line of
 people clapping and trying to look Scary. However, the leader of the sheep 
was not impressed with our antics and ran between 2 of us. The whole herd
squeezed through this 10  food chink, all 50 sheep. Quite a sight.  We sat
again, and the runners ran for about 30 minutes. This time slower.  And
it worked. We were much more organized this time, up till the end when
5 sheep broke away from the herd and took off. For about 3 or 4
hours Vegard and a gang chased them on foot, A task for which 'being good
 at American football is helpful', as Vegard put it.  He tackled 2 of
them,  and carried  them back to the pen over his shoulders.
We got the other 3 by re-setting up the whole funnel and organizing the
whole class again into Sitters and Runners. I sat. And it worked this
time.
We worked for several hours moving sheep from this pen down to the boat.
The usual method was to stick your head under the sheep and lift it up
with  a pair of feet on your left shoulder, and a pair on your right.
Worked  pretty well. Vegard's wife was taking stool samples and giving
the sheep parasite drugs. I mentioned she was pretty hard core also, and
this is no exception. If the sheep didn't offer a sample, she reached in
and took some. No flinch. Not something I've seen in San Diego. 

These sheep were loaded on to a small single-man row boat, and taken over
 to the big sail boat. Their fate was to be taken back to the school's
 farm and  be slaughtered in the coming week. Imagine a sheep with it's feet
tied  deciding to escape while it's on the row boat. Some pretty funny
stuff, including a few near capsizes.
<br>
The next morning we had the usual meating. I mean meeting. One of the
Farmering Sudents carried down a sheep in the same fashion as before, so I 
figured we had missed one. Then I noticed the tarp on the ground, and the
firewood in  the corner of the clearing, and things began to make sense. 
That was dinner.
<br>
The Farm girl  was trying to comfort the sheep who was, understandably, a
bit nervous.  Vegard changed to English for a few sentences: 'If you want
to eat the  meat, you have to watch the slaughtering'. At which point the 
vegetarians began walking to the tents, and the bucket, ax, and tarp were 
moved into position. Yea,  that surprised me to. Ax. Vegard sat on the 
sheep and held it on the ground by the horns while leaning on it to keep it 
still. Inar the Giant stepped up with the ax and started the swing, on the 
way down the sheep squirmed, and the Ax missed it's mark. The back side of 
the ax hit it in the head and the sheep began to squirm much more
earnestly. Inar hit it again, and  it's kept moving, the third hit
delivered a trickle of blood from it's nose  but it was the fourth hit
that finally stilled the animal. Within a few  seconds, Inar had hoisted
the sheep by the back feet and was holding it up  and over a bucket.
Vegard made a few quick moves and the blood ran out  while Vegard's Wife
quickly stirred the bucket to prevent clotting. That was it. The  body was
 moved over the the tarps, and Inar and Vegard began cutting the  skin.
They  slit open the legs, and pulled the skin off. The body cavity was
slit and  the intestines, heart, liver, and other bits were pulled out
and  tossed  into a waiting bucket, still steaming.  The process took a 
matter of minutes.
<br>
The animal was skewered onto a large stake, seasoned, and put near the 
fire, and cooked for 5 hours.
And that was the best tasting lamb I have ever had. Kind of odd to
remember when your dinner was alive, though.
The captain of the Viking was soon to have some trouble. The waves were
tossing the boat against the shore and the devices to prevent damage were
 not doing their job. Bent (that's his name) was leaning over the side
adjusting ropes and pads and trying to time things right so he would lean
 down as the boat came away from the shore, and stand up before the boat
was  tossed into the rocks on the next wave. He missed. The next wave
came a bit  faster then he thought and the boat lurched into the rocks
while he was  between the two. Remember 12000 kilos? Yea, it wasn't good,
I think  everybody was happy to hear he only broke a rib.
And the other injury! Østain fell off a cliff and landed on a sharp rock.
 The hole wasn't all that large, but several inches deep. Yea, inches.
They  took him to the nearest hospital and got sewn up. Scary thing is
when he  went to the doctors in his home town, they undid the stitches
and filled  the hole with cotton so the wound would close from the
bottom. Sounds like  the first doctors didn't do it right. Not
encouraging.

<br>The trip back was fairly uneventful. Oh! Northern Lights! Yes, a few
night of clear sky on the island resulted in some of the most beautiful
light  shows I've yet seen. They move! I didn't know that.
So, the trip back was fairly uneventful. We got back, unloaded the boat
and headed back to the school. One of the pots I was carrying from the
boat  had the top blown off by the tremendous wind. Which was not so bad,
but the  missing top reveled sheep testicles bobbing in a gallon of
blood. Not something I've done in San Diego.
<br>
That, finally is it. Hope it was worth the wait, and until next time, I
hope all is well in your neck of the woods.
<br>
-Byron
