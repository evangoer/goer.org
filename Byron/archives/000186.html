<span class="title">Norway #5</span>

Ok kiddies. I'm using an old, tried and true method of maintaining
readership. Cliff hanger. But this time it's with a twist. Last time I
teased you with the sheep slaughtering but never actually got to it, and
the conventional cliff hanger would fill you in on that now. But not me.
Hehehehe..
<br>
This next week was between the farm and our big trip to the sheep island,
 so it was a fairly normal week for us. If the word normal could be
applied  to any of our experiences at this place.
<br>
Our week began with wood shop. Yes, I'm sure visions of middle school
appear in you heads that the mention of those words, and your not too far
 off. Our first project is a wooden box. One piece of wood wrapped
around and laced shut in the front with birch root. A top and bottom are
added, and some carving is done for a final touch.
The project isn't all that difficult. What makes it hard is we use a lot
of  hand tools. A band saw is the only power tool, really. So all the
cutting  and carving and fitting is done with chisels and knifes and
hands. I'm not  all that good yet, so mine has character. And our teacher
is amazing. I'm  working on cutting or kifeing something and thinking I'm
clever and he  comes over and shows me a better way to do and had it half
done inside of  30 seconds. It's really impressive, and as usual, I'm
realizing I have a  lot to learn.
<br>
One of the ingredients for our box is roots of birch and eye of newt to
simmer in a black cauldron of raven's blood....
OK, just root of birch. So we went and got some birch roots, which is a
story I'm sure you are dying to hear. Tough, I'm gonna tell it anyway.
Birch trees grow all over Norway, with some conveniently located just
behind the school. Inconveniently it rained that day. All day. And all
night  before. And the area that the birch call home is  conveniently,
well,  wet land. So we were slogging in the rain in a marsh digging up
swamp crud  to find Birch roots. Not something I've done in  San Diego.
Sometimes, if  you stood still too long, the boot would sink into the
swamp and get stuck.  Which would be OK until you tried to walk. I spent
several minutes  unsticking a foot after nearly falling on my face when
my first step didn't work.
<br>
The box is progressing well. The side is wrapped and glued, and the
bottom  has made it so far without any major defects. The side has one,
it became  asymmetrical when I glued it together. Oh well. Character,
right?
<br>
The next two days were spend sailing. We took out the small boats, and I
and Sara got into the small one and took off. Sara's spent some time
sailing before,which is why we 'took off'. We tacked our way upwind to
see  the next town a little closer, which seemed like a cool goal. Sara
and I  were not really working hard, more like relaxing with some turns
worked in  when the land got too close. We chatted for most of the trip,
and I have to  say, she's a cool chick, for 20 years, she's got things
more together then  I do now. Our conversation turned to the school, and
how she has done this  kind of sailing at another school in Denmark. At
some point I got the  flavor that she may not be excited at doing this
again in the cold  Norwegian winter. We shall see if she hangs out or
not. At one point in our  journey, I looked out to find the other 2
boats, and they were way behind  us. We later found out that they were
'aiming for the bubbles'. There is a  machine that blows air into the
lake to keep it from getting stagnant, and  they were sailing back and
forth over this froth point. Easily amused. And  between us and them I
could see a small kayak, heading our way. Vegard was  catching up to us.
His teaching method of the day was to take out his  kayak, and cruise
between the 3 boats and comment on our performance. He  was now trying to
catch us. We sailed on. And he climbed on board about 3  minutes later.
Our best sailing wasn't that good, but it was good enough to  warrant a
'stay near the other boats' comment. That was encouraging.  Our  big boat
trip on the next day was very cool, very cold in fact. And  raining. And
big wind. We headed out into the fjord to go back and forth in easily the
biggest wind we've seen yet. Sailing over the choppy waves with the wind
pushing the boat sideways was an experience. Moving the sail is much
harder, sometimes impossible, and the leaning effect of the boat resulted
 in the comment :'If the water starts coming in over the side, just let
this  rope out all the way' I got while working the back of the boat. It
sure  kept me focused.  And the cold! It was near freezing with some
ridiculous  wind chill, and working with wet ropes. Good times.
<br>

Our last day was not sailing, but working on the boat house. It needed a
rock wall fixed and extended, some boards nailed to the beach, and other
fun stuff involving axes. The rock wall a bunch of large rocks stacked.
No  cement, no glue, just piled just right. Let me tell you, have respect
next  time you see a wall made of large rocks, it is much harder then it
looks.  Moving these things took 3 people with crowbars, and that was the
easy  part. Picking which rock to put in which hole to make the wall
stable, that  magic touch was far from obvious. We got most of the jobs
done fairly  quickly, which was good considering the above mentioned
cold.<br>

Stay tuned for next week's harrowing tail of Sheep Island!
<br>
Hope all is well in you neck of the woods,
<br>
-Byron
