Knife making for the week!

Yes, that's right. We took a week to make knives, not a bad deal at all. In the beginning, I thought the process was a little on the canned side, the blades were bought, the wood was already cut, and the cow was killed and skinned. This was in stark contrast to our usual experience at this school of doing the whole process by hand, ourselves. You may have gotten that idea from earlier posts....
<br>
After nearly finishing one knife on Monday, I was a bit skeptical how we would fill up a week with this project. And after I finished it completely on Thursday, I had more understanding... :)  I did manage to get a few handles carved in addition, but the bulk of the time was spend on the leather sheath, that thing is nasty. I think it consumed a day to cut out and sew together, and a day or so to carve neat thing into it. I manage to get 2 letters. A fellow student managed to get a dragon into hers. I should have hired her to finish mine. Oh well.
<br>
The others in the school who were not making knives were in one of 3 other groups: rope making, basket weaving, and ...something else...must not have been very good. It was pretty neat to see all the stuff we managed to actually make by hand. In a few weeks we get to to this course week again, this time massage is on the list!  Sometimes this place isn't all that rough.
