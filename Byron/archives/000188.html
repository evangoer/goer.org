<span class="title">London #1</span>

Short Version:
<br>
Our Norway journey gave way to a vacation in London that turned out to be 
quite nice, quite busy, quite tiring. London is huge, and I think we saw 
most of the important parts in our 12 day trip, and even got some Bath in. 
<br>
Long Version:
<br>
12 days in London.
On the first day in London, my Fiancee gave to me, one Partridge in a
Pear  Tree!
<br>
OK, enough singing jokes...
<br>
Day 1 :
We get to London via Bergen, so it wasn't too bad of a plane trip. It's
rather nice to get one hour jet lag when traveling to London. We decided
to try and travel light, so we fit everything into our backpacks,
something  that I now know is an utter necessity if you plan to travel
cheep and be on the move alot. Speaking of cheep, we found a room for 30
pounds a night.  About 50 bucks. Think Animal House in San Francisco and
your getting close  to our first impression. The house is set up like SF
joints, thin and tall with the narrow hallways filled with college agers
milling about smoking and drinking. Our room hadn't been cleaned, but
that  didn't really stand out. The curtain on the window was a wedged in
 blanket, the floor was a bit grungy, the bed was small and not exactly
quality, and the shower had it's own mop with a sign that said 'Please
clean  up after yourself'. Different. We slept.

<br>
Day 2:The morning came and we set out to be tourists. The first item on our
London To-Do list was a red double decker bus ride. We rode that bus for 
about an hour, mostly 'cause we got on going the wrong way, but
eventually  we ended up at Hyde Park and we walked our way to Buckingham
Palace.  Beautiful walk. Buckingham palace is  a bit ridiculous, with
those guys in  red strutting around. A few people came  and went from the
palace and the  guards didn't even look their  way. Some other guards
took  care of that.  Seem odd to have guards that  don't guard. Oh well.
Harods, the has- everything department store was  much  more interesting.
Imagine a upper  class Macy's that fills a whole mall  that's  been
squished into a cube,  and you're getting close. It's fancy,  ritzy,  and
friggin huge. There is a  room for meat, a room for bread, a room  for 
jewelry,etc.; all on the  first floor. There are 5 floors. A floor of
womens shoes. Sports wear  including polo outfits and saddles, half a
floor of stuffed animals.  Incredible. We spend half a day there. We ate
pizza early that day, which  was a very nice change from Norwegian food,
so we were able to take in some  Chocolate Fondue on floor 4  after
looking at the Christmas room on floor  2. I was quite impressed. We 
headed over to the Wedgewood room on floor 5  after.
<br>
Day 3:
Our tour book talked about these things called 'markets', and from the
description we decided to check one out. Portabello Market, they called
it.  It was just like the pictures on TV of those 3rd world countries
with  narrow streets and guys selling fish out of a van and enough people
that  you can't see anything beond the fish van in front of you. I was
pretty  amazed at this place, an entire road, maybe a mile of it, the
middle filled  with people trying to see the vendors that filled the
edges. We ate Mexican  food here. Oh, man, that was fantastic, and Karin
got a wallet, complete  with Underground Pass Pocket. Very London. Very
Sheik.
Dinosaurs at the History and Science Museum. I can't say too much about
the  place, you just have to go there. See more below. We went back
again.
<br>
Day 4 Bath: Not a bath, but Bath the town, now stop with the kiddie humor
 and pay attention. It's a damn nice place, and a huge change from
London.  It's much smaller  and quieter and still has as much history.
The Romans  built a R&R joint here  on top of the hot spring, and the
ruins are still  there. We toured this for  most of a day. Very cool.It
had the ruins and  history of the Romans, and  the 1700 buildup of the
city as a place of  healing. The water was suppose to  cure things. We
tried a glass, and it's  pretty nasty stuff.  And this was  all inside,
which was good because it  was raining the whole day. Karin and  I had
our Norway rain gear on, so it  was no problem, but it's just nice to  be
inside on those kinds of days. We  saw the Bath Abby. Similar to 
Westminster Abby, but less crowded with people, both living and dead. I 
have some really neet picture. For dinner we headed to Sally Lunn's for
one  of her Bunns. Karin had
rarebit. Not rabbit, but rarebit. It's a mix of  cheese melted over
bread. Very good stuff. Bree-ish.  And dessert was  fantastic- a Bunn
with strawberry jam and clotted cream. I'm not sure what  clotted cream
is, bu the effect is has on me is friggin fantastic. We went back again
just for this later in the trip.
<br>
Day 5 Bath 2:
We crazed Bath for our second day, this time taking it easy and doing the
 bus tours. Very nice time we had on this cool Monday. We were the only
people on the bus.
<br>
Day 6 Museums: Natural History and Victoria and Albert. Amazing. Think
Exploratatorium but as a museum and you're close. At the front door
greeting guests is one of those giant dinosaur skeletons filling the
room. And it
 only gets better. Each hall walks you through the why do I care problem
of  museums and makes an interactive show of the hight points. One
exhibit  showed the cycle of life with a rabbit who ate grass, shat,
died, decayed,  and ended with grass growing on the grave. At the end of
the tape, the  girls voice, who was asking questions to the parental
voice, demonstrated  her graspness of this world truth with :"Oh boy!,
Can we recycle another  rabbit?". Friggin funny stuff.
Best museum I've  seen. We went on 2 days. And took lunch breaks of
bread,  olives and cheese  on both days. Can't complain about that. Oh!
The also  have a full size model of a blue wale. Full size. Think about
it.

<br>
Day 7 Tower of London:
Today we Saw the Tower of London. And, if you are thinking what I was
thinking, let me set you straight: It's not just one tower.  It's huge.
It's a small town inside a wall, that's all inside another wall, that's
inside a moat (filled in in the 1800's). I was not prepared for this. We
walked around for 5 or 6 hours looking at stuff, listening to tours
guides
 and story tellers. Yes, story tellers. This guy dressed in costume said
to  the group 'small group today, does anyone have a story about the
tower that  they would like me to tell... I know most of them.' And he
wasn't kidding either. Guy Faulk? Yes. 20  minutes of talking where he
set the stage of  religious tensions of the 1700 complete with who did
what when to whom, then moved  into the details of the plot to blow up 
Parliament complete with names and  numbers, then finished with the
outcome  of Guy and his very shaky signature  on the confession after
spending a fortnight in the Tower. Any English  teacher would be proud. A
perfect Document Based Question answer.
We saw the Crown Jewels. It's amazing how much energy went into creating
trinkets for invented needs. The Coronation Ceremony involves 2 Scepters
with huge demands, and a crown. All of gold covered with jewels...well I
don't need to explain..it's the Crown Jewels.. and then there are half
dozen crowns, a dozen gold maces, some huge goblets and eating stuff, a
massive punch bowl-solid gold with intricate carvings.. all for a
grandiose  pissing contest of Mine's Bigger. What a life.
And the Armory! That was cool. All the gold trinkets is a waste of time,
but building suits of Armour and giant lances, now that's good use of the
 national GNP! It really was just like you imagine.  They had huge suits
 of 
armor  and swords and lances and  pikes and horse armor, and kids armor, 
and guns  and cannons, and then we  were into the 1800's or so when guns 
came about  and ended the reign of the  knight. But while it lasted it
was  what the  books were about. Simply amazing.

<br>
Day 8:
Headed over the see London by Bus. We did the open top tourist bus. I got
 to see where Tony Blair lives. And the most expensive hotel, where Tom
Cruz  likes to stay. And the hotel that Madonna prefers. Fascinating?
This took  most of the day, I think.  London Eye. We did not, however, go
more then  once on the London Eye. It's a Huge Ferris Wheel, with a much
more respectable name. You get to ride once around for about 15  bucks a
person,  and this one circle takes half an hour. From the top we  were
looking down  on Big Ben lit up in the night. I have pictures.
<br>
Day 9:
Bus Tour and British Museum. Fish n Chips.
The British Museum took us almost a day, and we didn't really see it all.
 The highlights were the Greek Pantheon and the dead old dudes, or, as
the  guide called them, Egyptian Mummies. In addition to this coolness,
they had  plaster casts of art from other places, including David. That
was neat to  see. Then we had lunch of bread, cheese, olives, and a hot
chocolate. We finished off the day with a England classic of Fish'n
Chips.  Pretty damn good.
<br>
Day 10:
If I had known how much we'd get done this day, I'd have scheduled it to
be  2. 4:30am we awoke to the neighborly sound of
People-so-Drunk-They-Don't-
 Know-How-Loud-They're-Talking arriving in the room upstairs. And their
floor, our ceiling, squeaked. About 5am something publish hit our
unlikable 1st floor window, 3 times.  So we left. So glad to have the
budget accommodations behind us. And due to our budget selection, we
didn't  feel 'comfortable' leaving our bags. So we carried them for the
rest of the  day. Keep that in mind as this day unfolds before you.  We
did some maintenance work with picking up pictures and trying to find
breakfast (London doesn't open till 9. We ate at McDonald's. Don't you
dare  tell anyone.) Then headed over to see the cathedrals. St Paul's was
first.  And easily the best building I've been in. Ridiculous may be a
good word here,  but I'll save that word for Westminster Abby. I'll call
this one  Amazing. It's  huge, and huge in all 3 dimensions, including a
500 step  walkway that takes  you up to a 'whispering gallery', where a
whisper will  bounce around the wall  of the tremendous dome that you're
standing in the  edge of. Looking down is not recommended for those
afraid of heights. Then  the stairs continue up  again to the top of the
dome and have a nice view of the city. Then the stairs continue up again,
to the point above the dome for a spectacular view  of the city. I have
pictures.
And under the floor of this building are the 'Catacombs', or the
'Crypt'..  or something equally enticing. It's filled with dead people
and odes to dead people. There were people that I've heard of lying
around down there, some  of the in enormous granite sarcophagus's.
Sarcophagi?  And a food court.
We headed over to Westminster Abbey to see that one while we were in the
neighborhood, and found a big line. After some humming and hawing we
decided to go anyway and he line moved pretty fast, kinda like a ride at
Disneyland. And the similarities didn't end there. It was almost a ride,
like Splash Mountain or Pirates of the Caribbean, only thing missing was 
sitting in a moving car. Or the water. That was also missing. It was a 
walking path that weaved  through the 'highlights' of the Abby. You 
couldn't roam around and admire,  you had to follow the path, and not too
 slowly of course, or the guy behind  you would complain. It weaved
though a  huge collection of dead people.  Kings and Queens, Dukes and
Duchesses, a  few of which even I had heard of.  That was rather
impressive, and the  amount of dead people that had managed  to pack into
this place was no less  impressive. Weaving through some of  the tight
places was sketchy with our  large packs (remember those?), and  turning
around was out of the question.  And all this stuff wasn't matched.  Now
I'm not one to criticize style, you've seen how I dress, but each of 
these large tombs was styled in it's own attention getting, grandiose,
not-like-the-others manner and it, well, clashed. The amount of and
exquisiteness  of these tombs was amazing, and how the place looked so
cluttered and messy  with these works of art packed inside it was no less
striking.
We made out way to Bath soon after and began our vacation from this
vacation. We got dinner at a Thai place in Bath, and it was good.
Wonderful, in fact. Norway just doesn't have flavor like this, we savored
 our curries like fine brandy. And then we slept well in the warm quite
of the B&B.
<br>
Day 11 Sunday:
After this long in London it was time to relax and do nothing. So we did
just that, except for these few exceptions: Breakfast. Cream Tea at Sally
 Lunns. Dinner at a pub. And working on the London Scrapbook. The pub had
 this great beer, Courage Best. I highly recommend it. The B&B was the
perfect place to this nothing, warm, comfortable, friendly, and we didn't
worry about our bags disappearing. How great is that?
<br>
12  Monday:
The end to our trip began with reluctantly gaining consciousness in a
tub. I  mean in Bath. We checked out of the B&B and moseyed around the
town for a  few hours doing some Christmas shopping looking for the ideal
gifts for our  parents and other loved ones. Booze mostly. The train ride
back to London  was nice and uneventful, just like we hoped. Our Last
Underground trip from  Paddingon to Victoria Station happened, and then
we were glad to have it  behind us. The crowds and mess of the
Underground epitomized what we came  to dislike about the city; despite
the positive characteristics of  efficiency and ease. We were glad to be
going home.
