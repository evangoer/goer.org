			<h1>Watercooler</h1>

			<p>It took me a while to figure it out. I think they don&rsquo;t know I know. Or they
			know, and don&rsquo;t care.</p>

			<p>I mean, I&rsquo;ve been here a while, now. Ever since the company started. Four
			years. Not like the rest of you temps. And you know, you just notice things
			after a while.</p>

			<p>Like Mr. Johnson &mdash; oops, I mean, &#8220;Jerry&#8221; &mdash; did he think I didn&rsquo;t
			<em>see</em> him change? Sure, it was gradual. Subtle. And it wasn&rsquo;t just the
			khakis, the polo shirts, the little nubbin of an earring. It was the hair, the
			wrinkles, everything. That&rsquo;s when I had my first inkling. Earthlings don&rsquo;t
			get&hellip; younger.</p>

			<p>It happened to all of them. Andrea from Finance. Steve from Engineering.
			Youn-seo from Sales. They all just got younger. Funkier. At first it was
			awkward. All these respectable-looking middle-aged people morphing before my
			eyes. Walking around in five-hundred dollar bike outfits. Shooting each other,
			clumsily, with nerf guns. Well, clumsily at <em>first</em>. The one thing about
			these people is that they&rsquo;re very curious, and they learn fast. Can you nerf
			someone right between the eyes from forty feet away&hellip; <em>every</em> freaking
			time? I can&rsquo;t. Neither can you.</p>

			<p>The bike outfits are a sham, of course. For one thing, these people are
			naturally aerodynamic. They don&rsquo;t need spandex. Ever checked out Julia? Up
			close, I mean? The planes of her face are too smooth, her cheekbones cut at at
			just too sharp an angle, don&rsquo;t you think? And there&rsquo;s no fine hair, no whorls,
			no little divots or pockmarks. There&rsquo;s just this healthy <em>glow</em>. And
			that fine layer of muscle beneath her skin&hellip; it twitches across her back,
			plays under your fingers. The thing is, there&rsquo;s nothing <em>there</em> there.
			She just looks at you the whole time, like, &#8220;Oh, isn&rsquo;t <em>this</em>
			interesting?&#8221;</p>

			<p>Anyway, they don&rsquo;t even need the bike outfits. They don&rsquo;t <em>commute</em>,
			man. They don&rsquo;t sleep. I know. I used to come in late. They&rsquo;re always up. 10pm.
			4am. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. No horseplay then, they just glide silently through the
			office, muttering in that indecipherable language of theirs. The zombies don&rsquo;t
			notice, they just clatter away at their keyboards.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;re wondering what they&rsquo;re working on, aren&rsquo;t you? The Product, right?
			Not me. It morphs too, you know. When I arrived, it was a revolutionary new
			chip. Then it was a handheld. Then it was a &#8220;solution&#8221;. Now I think it&rsquo;s back
			to a handheld. But I don&rsquo;t know for sure. All I know is, every year it&rsquo;s
			something new. They bring in new engineers all the time. Chew them up in waves.
			First it was the old guys. You know, the guys just five years from retirement?
			Joe, the paranoid black-helicopter crank. Fred Berkowitz, the guy with a shelf
			of CP-M manuals. I was like a nephew to all those guys. Well, they got used up
			awful fast.</p>

			<p>Then they brought in the college kids. Fresh out of Berkeley, Austin,
			Dartmouth. Man, those kids could work. I thought for a while that the kids
			weren&rsquo;t human either &mdash; that they could go all night, just like them. The kids
			thought this was <em>normal</em>. They even had the cute little rollaway beds,
			so they could be more like the bosses. Oh, and they <em>loved</em> Julia. Like
			little puppy dogs. One smile from her, and it was like three cups of coffee,
			there they were banging away at the code again.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was just the smile, though. A couple times I saw her with
			that little laser-pointer-looking thing in her hand. She was palming it, but I
			saw. A little flash of green light and boom! the little bunnies were going at
			it again.</p>

			<p>But they couldn&rsquo;t keep it up forever. Their boundless energy just melted
			away. They couldn&rsquo;t keep coming in late, working under those fluorescent
			lights. Nope, the same thing happened to them as the old guys. Pale faces,
			sunken eyes&hellip; the works. Wax automatons at the end. Some of them were on
			anything and everything to keep up, and those kids actually held out the
			longest. But they all went out at the end. One kid&rsquo;s hair turned
			<em>white</em>. I shit you not.</p>

			<p>So they were in a spot, &lsquo;cause most of the kids just flamed out at once.
			That was just after they got their third round of funding. It&rsquo;s easy for them.
			Like it grows on trees, you know? They just bring in the VCs, file into the
			office behind them like good little soldiers. They close the door, and then,
			two hours later&hellip; the VCs walk out, all smiles and handshakes. With slightly
			dazed looks on their faces. Oh, I&rsquo;ve listened at the door on occasion. You know
			what I hear? Nothing. That&rsquo;s right, nothing. No mumble, mumble, &#8220;ramp up in
			Q3&#8221;, mumble, mumble&hellip; just nothing. And the light under the door? It&rsquo;s dark,
			like they&rsquo;re giving a presentation&hellip; but every few minutes it flashes green.
			Think I&rsquo;m kidding? I heard Bill Hambrecht&rsquo;s coming in next week. You can see
			for yourself.</p>

			<p>Now it&rsquo;s almost all H1-Bs. Indian contractors. They work cheap, or so they
			say. Not that expense matters. Oh, they&rsquo;re keeping a low profile to be sure.
			Cutting costs. No more expensive parties. Less flying for the sales force. Did
			you know we don&rsquo;t have a single field office? Everyone&rsquo;s based locally. Oh,
			they say that it&rsquo;s more efficient that way. Teleconferencing and whatnot. The
			real reason? <em>The victims have to be in the building</em>. The turnover&rsquo;s
			just as bad in Sales as it is Engineering, by the way. Worse, even. And it&rsquo;s
			not just because we don&rsquo;t have anything in production yet.</p>

			<p>I think whatever it is, it&rsquo;s in the overhead lights. You ever notice how
			when they flicker, there&rsquo;s this kind of&hellip; pulse that runs through the office?
			Everyone kind of winces in unison, like they just got a toothache. And if one
			of them is gliding through&hellip; they take in this quick little breath, and their
			eyes widen. And then it&rsquo;s gone again. No one ever notices it. Feels it. Except
			me. Yeah, I know, you&rsquo;ve never seen it either. Well, I&rsquo;ve seen <em>you</em> do
			it.</p>

			<p>They&rsquo;re aging again, now. Most of them look forty again, although a
			well-preserved forty. I think it&rsquo;s by choice. Experience is in and all. And
			they&rsquo;ve gotten more subtle. The Indians don&rsquo;t look <em>quite</em> as bad as the
			kids did at this stage. Oh, they&rsquo;re starting to look a little
			under-the-weather, but I think they&rsquo;re going easier on the latest batch. After
			all, the Merc mentioned the company by name in a tech industry expose. They
			don&rsquo;t want <em>that</em> to happen again. &lsquo;Cause I know they&rsquo;re close. They&rsquo;re
			not <em>just</em> here to feed. But what are they really building? And why do
			they keep starting over, seemingly at random? No one knows. No engineer has
			been here long enough to put the puzzle together.</p>

			<p>How have I hung on this long? Good question. Glad you asked.</p>

			<p>I don&rsquo;t come in at night. And I don&rsquo;t fucking write code anymore, man. I&rsquo;m a
			receptionist. I work the front desk 8 to 5, in the sunlit lobby. I stay nice
			and unobtrusive. Surf the web, forward some emails. That&rsquo;s it. Yeah, I know I
			don&rsquo;t look so good. But <em>my</em> teeth haven&rsquo;t fallen out yet.</p>

			<p>And I&rsquo;m almost fully vested.</p>

			<h2>Commentary on Watercooler</h2>

			<p>I wrote <cite>Watercooler</cite> for the &#8220;Why I Hate Aliens&#8221; anthology. It&rsquo;s
			just a fun little piece that I wrote in a few hours. I started thinking, &#8220;Okay,
			why do we hate aliens? What do we <em>know</em> about them, anyway?&#8221; I was
			stuck for until I remembered the old writer&rsquo;s canard, &#8220;Write what you know.&#8221;
			<cite>Watercooler</cite> just flowed right out. Can&rsquo;t explain it.</p>
