<p>Goer: "What are you trying to tell me?  That I can dodge control characters in comments?"</p>
<p><a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/">Distler</a>: "No, Evan. I am trying to tell you that when you're ready... <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000161.html">you won't have to</a>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Whoa.</em></p>

<p>As you can see, we<sup><a href="#14-1">1</a></sup> here at goer.org are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the new <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/">Matrix</a> movie.  I don't particularly care about the alleged <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/new_phil_main.html">philosophical ruminations</a> of The Matrix, all of which have been examined at length by earlier philosophers and writers.  At best we can say that The Matrix has tied up these concepts and presented them in an appealing package.  Which is something, at least.</p>

<p>Nope, I'm there for the action.  I want to see Mr. Anderson wiping the floor with a hundred Mr. Smiths.  I want to see Morpheus battling the Twins. Most of all, I want to see Trinity dealing out destruction while clad in black vinyl.  Some might roll their eyes, thinking the black vinyl outfits to be hackneyed and cliched... faux cool.  Hey, I'm just sayin', I think Carrie-Anne Moss makes it work.</p>

<p>Finally, I apologize for the new, temporary, Matrix-themed style sheet.<sup><a href="#14-2">2</a></sup>  Unfortunately this site does not provide a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/">style sheet switcher</a>, so I'm afraid that if you don't like the new look, you're going to just have to suffer for the next couple of weeks.  Please don't be angry with me.  Instead only try to realize the truth:  there is no style sheet.  Then you'll see that it is not the style sheet that changes, it is only yourself.</p>

<p><a name="14-1"></a><small>1. Meaning,  of course, "me".</small></p>

<p><a name="14-2"></a><small>2. If you don't see any difference... then as <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman</a> likes to say, "Kindly reload." </small></p>

<p>The <a href="/Markup/TheXPhiles/">X-Philes</a> grow ever larger.  It's become clear that I need to make some clarifications in how the tests work -- that I have to state a couple of things explicitly, and that I might need to tighten up the rules to close some loopholes.  In the meantime, we muddle through, as we must.  Of particular interest in the latest batch: <a href="http://zeus.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~jg307/">James Graham</a>, a UK physics student who is <a href="http://zeus.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~jg307/work/muon.xml">embedding MathML</a> in certain pages on his site.  (Click to advance through the slides on the MathML page.)  Also we must give due respect to <a href="http://saintraphaelacademy.org/">St. Raphael Academy</a>, which might very well be the most techologically advanced secondary school website <em>ever</em>.  Certainly it beats the pants off of <em>my</em> alma mater's site, which has lovely bordered frames, scrolling headline text courtesy of the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag, and no DOCTYPE, presumably to spare us all from the horror.  Of course it <em>is</em> a cash-starved California public school.  I blame Gray Davis <em>personally</em>.<sup><a href="#11-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I've also added a "Useful Reading" list to the <a href="/Markup/">Markup</a> section.  This list constitutes a small fraction of the external articles and documents that have been instrumental in shaping my thinking on <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and web standards.  Of course I can't begin to list all the articles I've read, nor can I provide access to all the personal emails and comments I've received of late.  My thinking on this issue is still evolving.  Still pulling things together.  More to come. </p>

<p><small><a name="11-1"></a>1. Apparently so do <a href="http://www.recallgraydavis.com/">others</a>.  Some people take their school's website design <em>awfully</em> seriously.</small></p>

<p>Whoa, a <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000158.html">cluster bomb</a>?  I hope not!  Sounds dangerous.</p>

<p>Well, it <em>has</em> been rather busy around here.  I've decided to collect all posts that are even vaguely markup-related and display them in a <a href="/Markup/">central repository</a>.  I've also included a <strong><a href="/Markup/TheXPhiles/">list of sites that pass</a></strong> the <a href="http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/Apr/#tests"><acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> 100 test suite</a>.  Again, we're only testing validation and MIME-types.  I'm purposefully ignoring Test #4, the "Why Are You Doing This" Test.  You could be one of those rarified individuals that has actual technical reasons for using XHTML.  Or you could be doing it for "softer" reasons:  for political advocacy, as a personal learning  experience, or simply to prove to yourself that you can do it.  It's all fine as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<p>Note that I tried to add the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">W3C Markup</a> pages to the list, but failed.  The main page validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict and provides the proper MIME-type to Mozilla.  However, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">second link</a> I happened to grab is valid but serves up <code>text/html</code>.  Ditto for the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validator</a>.<sup><a href="#9-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The only downside is that on our sidebar we have to say goodbye to guest-blogger <a href="/Byron/">Byron Kubert</a>.  Byron's adventures in Norwegian Viking School were gripping, but now he's back in the States, and he hasn't posted in months.  He'll still be accessible from the front page, though.<sup><a href="#9-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Final note:  I'd like to offer particular congratulations to stalwart young U.K. computer scientist <a href="http://www.xiven.com/">Thomas Pike</a> and his comrade and countryman, <a href="http://www.aagh.net/">Thomas Hurst</a>.  Both of them serve up their pages as XHTML 1.1 to browsers that accept <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> and HTML 4.01 Strict to browsers that don't -- tags and everything.  Now that, my friends, is <strong>real</strong> content negotiation.  Gentlemen, I salute you.</p>

<p><a name="9-1"></a><small>1. On the plus side, you can validate the validation of the validator.  What fun!</small></p>

<p><a name="9-2"></a><small>2. It's a good thing Byron spent more time sailing ships and less time learning how to cleave skulls with an axe, or else I'd be a little worried about demoting him.</small></p>

Reformulating your site as XHTML requires <em>a major rethinking of everything you are doing</em>.  Proceed with caution.  Ask yourself <em>why</em>.

Of course, this doesn't preclude me from padding the numbers by starting arguments with myself.

"Listen! And understand! That Validator is out there. It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, EVER... until you are validated!"

"Zombies are supernatural beings, therefore difficult to kill. Repeated shots are necessary to stop them as they rush headlong toward the player. He must not only be alert to the appearance of zombies from any quarter; he must be assiduous about reloading his gun periodically, lest he be overwhelmed by the rush of the zombies when his gun is empty."

After browsing his site for a while, I have come to the inescapable conclusion that <em>Jacques Distler may well be the only person on the planet who understands the XHTML 1 specification and uses it properly</em>.
