			<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

			<p>As it says on the <a href="/">front page</a>, my name is Evan Goer, and I'm a <a href="/About/Resume/evangoer-resume-web.html">software engineer</a> working in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

			<p>My family moved to the Bay Area in 1977, so technically, I'm not a native. But by California standards, moving here when you're less than three years old is basically the equivalent of being a flinty-eyed ninth generation New Hampshire farmer.<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. If you've lived here at least ten years, the only person who is allowed to look down on you for not being a Real Californian is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-I-Was-Joan-Didion/dp/0679433325">Joan Didion</a>.</p>

			<p>I attended public elementary school, middle school, and high school in and around my hometown of Sunnyvale, CA. After that, college at <a href="http://hmc.edu">Harvey Mudd</a>, followed by a year of graduate school at <a href="http://www.ucsb.edu">UCSB</a>. It turns out that there's a big difference between "being good at physics homework and tests" and "being a successful working physicist." So off into the world of work I went!</p>

			<p>Fortunately, in 1999 they were hiring anyone with a pulse.<sup>[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]</sup> Even more fortunately, my new boss brought me into a fantastic group of technical writers who took me under their wing, even though I was a lowly contractor. Over the years I worked as an API writer for at companies large and small. Along the way, I wrote a <a href="/YUI/">book about YUI 3</a>. That book got me interested in frontend development, so much so that I eventually switched over software engineering. Wish me... luck?</p>

			<p id="ref1" class="footnote">1. In New Hampshire, obviously.</p>

			<p id="ref2" class="footnote">2. I had vaguely heard of this "technical writing" thing -- it was technical, and I was technical. And it involved writing, and I liked writing! So there you go.</p>

			<h2 id="site">Website</h2>

			<p>This website is powered by <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/">Movable Type 5</a>. I've been using MT for many years. Before that, the site and the journal was completely hand-coded, until I realized that was kind of silly.</p>

			<p>This site uses <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">HTML5</a>, although it doesn't use many HTML5 features per se. Mostly I just like the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#the-doctype">remarkably short and cute DOCTYPE</a>.</p>

			<p>For layout, I use the <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">outstanding YUI CSS libraries</a> made available by my colleagues down the hall at Yahoo!.</p>

			<p>The primary font for this site is Garamond. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/12481">Which Garamond</a>, you ask? I honestly have no idea. Whatever Garamond your browser displays when the site says <code>font-family: garamond</code>. The one thing I <em>do</em> know is that it is not the Garamond that <a href="http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=2577">typography nerds really, really hate</a>.

			<p>As for why I started up the <a href="/Journal/">Journal</a>, that's all due to my blogmother, <a href="http://mrissa.livejournal.com">Marissa Lingen</a>. Without her, there would be a website of sorts, but there would be no <a href="/Journal/2006/06/towards_a_unified_bad_movie_classification_system.html">Bad Movie Classification System</a>, no <a href="/Journal/2003/10/html_house_of_horror_things_that_go_blink_in_the_n.html">HTML House of Horror</a>, no <a href="/Journal/2007/09/hoisted_from_comments_magazines_for_the_west_coast.html">Magazines for the West Coast Elitist</a>, and worst of all, no <a href="/Journal/2006/08/literary_vs_genre_explained_using_pie.html">pie</a>. </p>
